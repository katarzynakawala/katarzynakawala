welcome to my github page. My name is Kasia and here you can find some projects that I enjoy doing in my spare time. :computer:

I have over 6 years of experience as a QA developer :bug:.  I enjoy writing automated scripts in Java and Groovy. But I also love creating some APIs.
I've made some projects in Java (which you can see below) but recently I felt madly in love with Go. :blue_heart:
What I like about Go is how nice it feels to write code using it and how intuitive that is. 

And build-in testing framework is also a big plus for me. :heavy_plus_sign:



ðŸ˜„ My Pronouns: she/ they

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently preparing myself for AWS certification (AWS Solution Architect)

:sunny: When I don't code I take a lot of photos and cook vegan dishes
